# 32Blit Pico Graphics Toy

This repository exists to create pixel-perfect example images for the Pico Graphics documentation. It's really not useful otherwise!

It only uses 32blit's wonderful cross-platform framework/boilerplate to get us drawing stuff to an SDL window with a minimum of effort.

By all means... run it on your blit if you want but it wont be very interesting!
